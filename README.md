# Building-a-Recommendation-system-with-Python
Using Machine Learning to build a Recommendation system based on some metrics


This repo introduces and discovers how to use Python—and some essential machine learning concepts—to build programs that can make recommendations. This covers the different types of recommendation systems out there, and shows how to build each one. The Notebook helps you learn the concepts behind how recommendation systems work by taking you through a series of examples and exercises. Which also explains how to apply statistical and machine learning methods to construct your own recommenders, demonstrating how to build a popularity-based recommender using the Pandas library, how to recommend similar items based on correlation, and how to deploy various machine learning algorithms to make recommendations. 


Objectives:

Working with recommendation systems
Evaluating similarity based on correlation
Building a popularity-based recommender
Classification-based recommendations
Making a collaborative filtering system
Content-based recommender systems
Evaluating recommenders
